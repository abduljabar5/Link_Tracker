# Linkafy: Advanced Link Tracking Application

## Project Description
Linkafy is an innovative link tracking application that provides detailed analytics on web link traffic. Leveraging the power of Next.js, React, and Node.js, Linkafy offers users the ability to convert their original URLs into trackable links. Upon registering, users can generate new links that monitor click counts and geographic locations of each click. This platform ensures the speed and efficiency of link redirection, maintaining a seamless user experience.

### Challenges
The primary challenge in developing Linkafy was optimizing the link tracking process to eliminate any noticeable delays, ensuring users experience seamless redirection to the original link while capturing crucial click and location data.

## Application Features
- **Unlimited Link Tracking**: Track an unlimited number of links.
- **Click and Location Analytics**: Gain insights into the number of clicks and geographical locations.
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login through NextAuth.
- **Performance Optimization**: Fast and efficient link redirection post-data capture.
- **Geolocation Tracking**: Precise analytics using geolocation technology.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: To build dynamic user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side application development.
- **NextAuth**: For authentication and security.
- **Geolocation**: To track the geographical location of link clicks.

## Project Requirements
- High efficiency in link redirection post-tracking.
- Robust user authentication and security.
- Accurate geolocation tracking for link clicks.
- Capability to handle high volumes of links and click data without performance issues.
- Responsive design for a seamless experience across various devices.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
